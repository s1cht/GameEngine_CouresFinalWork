# Custom Game Engine with Editor

## Overview

This is a custom game engine developed using **C++** and **DirectX 11**. The engine is designed for real-time rendering, supporting custom physics, 3D models, and a user-friendly editor interface for creating, saving, and loading game elements. The goal is to offer a flexible environment where users can build simple game prototypes and experiment with different mechanics.

## Features

- **Real-time rendering**: Smooth real-time rendering using **DirectX 11**, optimized for performance.
- **User-defined objects**: Users can add, save, and load parts within the editor.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/s1cht/GameEngine_CouresFinalWork
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022 or any other C++ IDE that supports DirectX 11.

3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

1. **Creating Objects**: Use the editor interface to add parts and position them in the scene.
2. **Saving and Loading**: You can save and load objects using the custom file format integrated with the engine.
3. **Custom Scripts**: Add your scripts or logic via the scripting module to control object behaviors.

## Requirements

- **C++17**
- **DirectX 11 SDK**
- **Visual Studio 2022**
